    "There are several methods and techniques used for web scraping, depending on the complexity of the task and the tools being employed. Here are some commonly used methods for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual Copy-Pasting: This is the most basic form of web scraping, where data is manually copied and pasted from web pages into a local file or spreadsheet. It is suitable for small-scale data extraction but can be time-consuming and not practical for large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are powerful patterns that can be used to extract specific data from web pages. They are particularly useful when the data follows a specific pattern or structure. Regex can be employed in conjunction with programming languages like Python to extract data matching the defined patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HTML Parsing: HTML parsing involves parsing the HTML structure of web pages using libraries like BeautifulSoup or lxml in Python. These libraries provide functions and methods to navigate and extract data based on HTML tags, attributes, and element structures. HTML parsing is effective for scraping structured data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Web Scraping Libraries: There are several web scraping libraries available that simplify the scraping process. For example, libraries like Scrapy and Selenium offer robust tools and frameworks to automate web scraping tasks. They provide functionalities like handling cookies, managing sessions, interacting with JavaScript elements, and handling complex scraping scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. API Scraping: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide structured data access. APIs allow developers to retrieve data directly in a structured format (JSON, XML, etc.), bypassing the need for web scraping. However, if an API is not available or does not provide the required data, traditional web scraping methods can still be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Headless Browsers: Headless browsers, such as Puppeteer (for Node.js) or Selenium WebDriver (for various programming languages), simulate a real web browser without a graphical user interface. They can be used to interact with dynamic websites, fill forms, click buttons, and extract data. Headless browsers are particularly useful for scraping websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for rendering content."

It supports various searching techniques, such as finding elements by tag name, class, id, attribute values, or CSS selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Extraction: Beautiful Soup makes it easy to extract specific data from web pages by providing methods and attributes to access and manipulate the content of HTML/XML elements. It allows developers to extract text, retrieve attribute values, access parent/child/sibling elements, or iterate over matching elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Robustness and Compatibility: Beautiful Soup is designed to handle imperfect and inconsistent HTML/XML structures encountered on real-world websites. It employs a lenient parsing strategy that can recover from errors and adapt to various parsing scenarios.
